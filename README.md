## Refactored Code

In the index.html file I refactored the code in the following ways:

1.Added Alt attributes to all Img tags. 2. Changed the div tags to the appropriate semantic elements. 3. Added comments to the file.

In the style.css file I refactored the code in the following ways:

1. Grouped up same selectors with similar properties and values.
2. Changed the selectors to match the semantic elements that were added to the html file.
3. Added comments to the file.
